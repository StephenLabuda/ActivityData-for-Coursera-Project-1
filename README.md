# ActivityData-for-Coursera-Project-1
This repo is for a Coursera Submission


**The following repo contains two files:**

read_activity.R

activity_data.Rmd


**read_activity.R**  
This file is just a compilation of all of the code that I used in my markdown file. I wanted to include this document so that all the code could be in the same .R file.  
**activity_data.Rmd**  
This file is what has the submission criteria for the project. The markdown file has text descriptions for the purpose of each chunk of code and how I went about solving the problem.
